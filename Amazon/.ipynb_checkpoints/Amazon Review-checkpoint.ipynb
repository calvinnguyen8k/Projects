When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.

One of my main recommendations for working with this dataset and model is either use a GPU, a subset of the dataset, or plenty of time to train your model. As you might be able to expect, the model will not be able to make good predictions just by seeing many reviews, it needs so see the reviews many times to be able to understand the relationship between words and between descriptions & summaries. \n",

I'll try to improve this model and if it gets better, I'll update my GitHub.\n",
